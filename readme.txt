Allows custom avatars for every comment.

== Description ==

This was initially written for a client and he agreed to open-source it. Thanks, John! Your visitors will be able to choose from the avatars you upload to your website for each and every comment they make. Various configuration options are available.

See a [live demo](http://www.nkuttler.de/wordpress/custom-avatars-for-comments/) on the plugin's home page.

= My plugins =

[Better tag cloud](http://www.nkuttler.de/wordpress/nktagcloud/): I was pretty unhappy with the default WordPress tag cloud widget. This one is more powerful and offers a list HTML markup that is consistent with most other widgets.

[Theme switch](http://www.nkuttler.de/wordpress/nkthemeswitch/): I like to tweak my main theme that I use on a variety of blogs. If you have ever done this you know how annoying it can be to break things for visitors of your blog. This plugin allows you to use a different theme than the one used for your visitors when you are logged in.

[Zero Conf Mail](http://www.nkuttler.de/wordpress/zero-conf-mail/): Simple mail contact form, the way I like it. No ajax, no bloat. No configuration necessary, but possible.

[Move WordPress comments](http://www.nkuttler.de/wordpress/nkmovecomments/): This plugin adds a small form to every comment on your blog. The form is only added for admins and allows you to [move comments](http://www.nkuttler.de/nkmovecomments/) to a different post/page and to fix comment threading.

[Delete Pending Comments](http://www.nkuttler.de/wordpress/delete-pending-comments): This is a plugin that lets you delete all pending comments at once. Useful for spam victims.

[Snow and more](http://www.nkuttler.de/wordpress/nksnow/): This one lets you see snowflakes, leaves, raindrops, balloons or custom images fall down or float upwards on your blog.

[Fireworks](http://www.nkuttler.de/wordpress/nkfireworks/): The name says it all, see fireworks on your blog!

[Rhyming widget](http://www.rhymebox.de/blog/rhymebox-widget/): I wrote a little online [rhyming dictionary](http://www.rhymebox.com/). This is a widget to search it directly from one of your sidebars.

== Installation ==

1. Unzip

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

Q: I have uploaded avatars, there is no error message on the settings page, but I still can't see the avatar selection field<br />
A: Your theme is most likely broken. Tell your theme developer to read the [Theme Development](http://codex.wordpress.org/Theme_Development) page and to add the comment_form action.

Q: I don't like where the avatar selection field shows up on the page.<br />
A: Perform the following steps:
1. Find the comments.php file in your theme directory and open it in an editor. Alternatively edit it through the WordPress theme editor under Appearance-Editor. If your theme doesn't use a comments.php search for a file with a wp_list_comments call or with the comments form.
2. Add `<?php global $CommentAvatarsFrontend; if ( isset( $CommentAvatarsFrontend ) ) $CommentAvatarsFrontend->select(); ?>` where the avatar select list should appear.
3. Check the "Don't show the select field automatically." box on the settings page.

Q: How do I remove the link to the plugin homepage?<br />
A: Please read the plugin's settings page, you can disable it there.
